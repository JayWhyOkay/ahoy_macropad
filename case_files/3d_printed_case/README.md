# Ahoy Macropad 3D Printed Case

The 3D Printed case is included for those that have access to a 3D printer and want to avoid the higher costs of sourcing acrylic for laser cutting. 

The top half includes an integrated plate for the switches and PCB. The bottom half is angled for a smoother typing experience. 

## Instructions

### Print Settings 

Print both the top and bottom files using the slicer and filament of your choice. 

The print settings should be based off your printer and filament. PLA and ASA were tested with sufficient results. 

Post processing of print lines on the bottom half is optional, but recommended for a smooth fit between the top and bottom half.

### Assembly

In the top piece, there are 4 holes in the corners. These are intended for brass threaded inserts. 

The inserts specs are the following:
- Thread size: M3
- Length: 5mm
- Outer Diameter: 5.2mm 
- Pitch: 0.5mm (this shouldnt matter)

4 M3x8mm screws should then be used to screw the top and bottom half together.
