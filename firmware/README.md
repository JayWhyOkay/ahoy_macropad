# Ahoy Macropad Firmware

To flash the keyboard, please use QMK Toolbox or other flashing tools to flash an Atmega32U4. The bootloader is based off the factory-based Atmel-DFU.

The firmware is VIA compatible.

To load the board into VIA, enable the "Design" tab in your VIA program, then load the JSON file in VIA.
