# Ahoy Macropad Acrylic Casing
This section is to order a case if you happen to stumble/own a PCB for this. 

The case consists of stacked acrylic pieces that combine together to make the final product.

The design files were ordered from [Ponoko](https://www.ponoko.com/), which, in my experience, is one of the cheaper places to order laser cut acrylic pieces on demand in low quantity. 

## Parts, dimensions, thickness (from bottom to top)
In order to order this case, you will need to source the following:
- 1x ahoy_bottom - *135.8mm x 107.2mm* - **3mm thickness acrylic (CLEAR, FROSTED, OR OPAL for the RGB underglow)**
- 1x ahoy_mid_1 - *135.8mm x 107.2mm* - **3mm thickness acrylic (CLEAR, FROSTED, OR OPAL for the RGB underglow)**
- 1x ahoy_mid_2 - *135.8mm x 107.2mm* - **3mm thickness acrylic**
- 1x ahoy_plate - *135.8mm x 107.2mm* - **3mm thickness acrylic**
- 2x ahoy_top (for high profile look) - *135.8mm x 107.2mm* - **3mm thickness acrylic**

### Screws and other components
- 6x M2.5 Screws 
    - for a high-profile look, source 20mm length screws 
    - for a low-profile look (no *ahoy_top* pieces), source 14mm length screws
